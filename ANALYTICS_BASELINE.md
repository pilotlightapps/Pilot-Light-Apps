# Analytics baselines

Recorded before the Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon was published on the website
and before the Display / Audio Switcher testing build was linked publicly.

- Cloudflare site created: 2026-08-21
- Dashboard reading at setup: **0 visits / 0 page views**
- Site tag: `aff3e8f6812e48f08ca1f6ff199ee934`
- The first visits after publication include Pilot Light Apps release-verification
  traffic and must not be described as outside visitors.

## Wallpaper Pilot

- Recorded: 2026-08-21 10:06:13 Central time
- GitHub release: `v1.0.1`
- Release asset: `Wallpaper-Pilot.exe`
- GitHub download count: **5**

## Display / Audio Switcher testing build

- Recorded: 2026-08-21 before publication
- GitHub tag: `display-audio-switcher-v0.9.0-testing`
- Release asset: `DisplayAudioSwitcher-Windows.zip`
- GitHub download count before publication: **0**
- ZIP SHA-256: `76398A6595CAF830546D54640DEDBA001DB24C9A0C8E5F01D518A6D1A5A58557`

## Release-verification traffic

- Recorded: 2026-08-21 12:03 Central time
- The testing release was published as a GitHub prerelease, not Latest.
- GitHub reported the ZIP as 32,388,211 bytes with the same SHA-256 digest.
- Pilot Light Apps downloaded the public ZIP once for release verification.
- The downloaded file was 32,388,211 bytes, matched the recorded SHA-256, and
  opened as a valid ZIP with 1,370 entries.
- GitHub's asset API still reported a count of **0** immediately afterward; the
  count may update later or may not count that verification client.
- The live home and Privacy pages both contained the manual Cloudflare beacon.
- Cloudflare still showed **0 visits / 0 page views** immediately after
  publication. Analytics ingestion can lag, so later dashboard activity should
  be compared with the zero-at-setup baseline rather than backdated.

## How to interpret the count

GitHub's release-asset count is an approximate number of downloads, not a count
of unique people or successful installations. It may include our own tests,
repeat downloads, automated requests, or incomplete downloads. Downloads made
before this baseline cannot be separated by source.

For future Wallpaper Pilot reporting, subtract 5 from the current v1.0.1 asset
count to estimate downloads recorded after this baseline. The testing-build
baseline starts at zero; our own public verification download must be identified
separately from outside downloads.

Cloudflare Web Analytics and GitHub download counts measure different actions and
should not be treated as an exact conversion funnel. Version-specific website
links keep each app's GitHub asset count separate as the catalog expands.

## Stable switcher launch and catalog-page baseline

- Recorded: 2026-08-22 before the redesigned website was published.
- Cloudflare Web Analytics showed **0 visits / 0 page views** for the last 24
  hours. The site had been created about 20 hours earlier.
- Wallpaper Pilot `v1.0.1` asset count: **6** downloads.
- Display / Audio Switcher testing ZIP asset count: **3** downloads.
- New stable tag: `display-audio-switcher-v1.0.0`.
- Stable ZIP asset count immediately after publication and before verification:
  **0** downloads.
- Stable ZIP size: **32,874,724 bytes**.
- Stable ZIP SHA-256:
  `CA502F8EDD8263E0F447DC2E1FB1947554B23D3EA1FA7AEFBCD800F2E6D47766`.
- Pilot Light Apps then downloaded the stable public ZIP once for release
  verification. It matched the recorded size and SHA-256, opened successfully,
  contained 1,385 entries under one `DisplayAudioSwitcher` folder, and included
  the executable and download README.
- GitHub later reported the stable ZIP count as **1**, matching the identified
  Pilot Light Apps verification download. Outside downloads therefore begin
  above this count, subject to GitHub's normal counting limitations.
- The redesigned site gives each app a dedicated URL. Compare page views for
  `/wallpaper-pilot.html` and `/display-audio-switcher.html` with the separate
  GitHub asset counts; do not describe the difference as a precise conversion
  rate or unique-user count.

## August 24 search and distribution checkpoint

- Google Search Console showed **4 impressions, 1 click, 25% CTR, and an
  average position of 6.3**. Two impressions and the click were attributed to
  `https://pilotlightapps.com/`; two impressions were attributed to the old
  `http://www.pilotlightapps.com/` form, which redirects to the canonical site.
- The submitted sitemap was successful, was last read August 23, and reported
  **10 discovered pages**.
- Cloudflare Web Analytics still showed **0 visits / 0 page views** for the
  prior seven days. The live homepage contained the expected beacon and token
  with no browser-console error, so the disagreement with the Search Console
  click is recorded rather than resolved by assumption. Possible explanations
  include blocked analytics, low-volume reporting behavior, or ingestion delay.
- Wallpaper Pilot `v1.0.1` remained at **6** recorded asset downloads: one above
  the August 21 baseline, with source and uniqueness unknown.
- Display / Audio Switcher `v1.0.0` remained at **1** recorded ZIP download,
  matching the identified Pilot Light Apps verification download. No outside
  Switcher download is confirmed yet.
- Public discovery expanded on August 24 with a Pilot Light Apps profile post,
  a Developer-tagged r/windowsapps post for Display / Audio Switcher, and public
  itch.io pages for both apps:
  - `https://www.reddit.com/user/Visible-Current-3909/comments/1vx9c1r/display_audio_switcher_100_a_free_windows/`
  - `https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsapps/comments/1vx9ciu/display_audio_switcher_100_switch_a_windows/`
  - `https://echoofhumanity50.itch.io/wallpaper-pilot`
  - `https://echoofhumanity50.itch.io/display-audio-switcher`
- These publications happened after the download counts above were recorded.
  Check later activity against the existing **6** Wallpaper Pilot and **1**
  Switcher baselines rather than attributing earlier counts to these channels.
- Support-email routing was intentionally deferred while app and project inboxes
  are consolidated separately. No Gmail, Cloudflare Email Routing, or DNS change
  is part of this distribution checkpoint.

## Picture Pilot testing launch baseline

- Recorded: 2026-09-12 before the testing release and website page were published.
- GitHub tag: `picture-pilot-sorter-v0.5.0-beta.2-testing`.
- Release asset: `PicturePilotSorter-Windows-0.5.0-beta.2.zip`.
- GitHub download count before publication: **0**.
- ZIP size: **51,296,382 bytes**.
- ZIP SHA-256:
  `08FC29E19EFE0201AC648B715AD148D9BFE504B331546A546AF6162042E1BBA0`.
- The website status is **Testing — not final**. Marketing and general feedback
  outreach remain on hold until the user downloads this exact asset through the
  live site and completes the separate-computer acceptance test.

## September 14 distribution and search checkpoint

- GitHub release-asset counts were **10** for Wallpaper Pilot `v1.0.1`, **2**
  for Display / Audio Switcher `v1.0.0`, and **2** for Picture Pilot Sorter
  `0.5.0-beta.2`. Compared with the August 24 campaign baselines, this is four
  additional Wallpaper Pilot downloads and one additional Switcher download.
  One of the two Picture Pilot downloads is the identified Pilot Light Apps
  public-verification download. These remain download events, not unique-user
  or successful-installation counts.
- itch.io's last-30-days creator dashboard showed **1 view / 0 downloads** for
  Display / Audio Switcher and **0 views / 0 downloads** for Wallpaper Pilot,
  with no recorded revenue or payment. Both full-release apps remain public on
  itch.io; Picture Pilot is intentionally absent while testing continues.
- Cloudflare Web Analytics showed **0 visits / 0 page views** for the preceding
  seven days.
- Google Search Console's three-month report showed **52 impressions, 1 click,
  1.9% CTR, and average position 18.7**. The latest seven-day window showed
  **6 impressions, 0 clicks, 0% CTR, and average position 15.5**.
- Google's submitted sitemap was still marked Success but had last been read on
  September 6 and reported **10 discovered pages**. The current sitemap has 11
  URLs, and URL Inspection reported that
  `https://pilotlightapps.com/picture-pilot.html` was unknown to Google. On
  September 14, the current sitemap was successfully resubmitted and Google
  accepted a Picture Pilot indexing request into its priority crawl queue.
  Discovery and indexing counts have not updated yet.
- Bing Webmaster Tools is configured for `https://pilotlightapps.com/`. Its
  visible sitemap row was successful, last submitted and crawled on September 4,
  and reported **10 discovered URLs**. Bing's summary showed 2 known sitemaps and
  20 total discovered URLs although only one row was visible. On September 14,
  Bing accepted the current sitemap for processing; the row showed the new
  submission date while retaining the September 4 crawl and 10 discovered URLs.
- Reddit's current public counts were **567 views / 2 upvotes / 1 comment** for
  the September 9 Wallpaper Pilot post in `r/software`, **428 views / 2 upvotes
  / 0 comments** for the Display / Audio Switcher post in `r/windowsapps`, and
  **3.2K views / 8 upvotes / 3 comments** for the earlier Wallpaper Pilot post
  in `r/windowsapps`. The one new `r/software` comment was a hostile AI/developer
  accusation rather than a support question; no reply was sent.
- AlternativeTo confirmed that Wallpaper Pilot and Display / Audio Switcher
  were both submitted on September 4 and are still awaiting review in the normal
  queue. Pending submissions do not appear in public search. Optional priority
  review costs **$5 per app** and was not purchased. The account showed no chats
  and no notifications requiring a response.
- Buy Me a Coffee's `capto50z` owner dashboard showed **0 supporters and $0
  all-time**, and its unread Messages view was empty.
- The Zoho support mailbox session was restored and live-verified on September
  14. Inbox, unread mail, spam, notifications, and All Messages contained no
  customer questions or support requests requiring a response. The unread items
  were three sign-in OTP messages, Zoho welcome mail, and a Zoho product update;
  spam contained one Zoho marketing message. Nothing was sent or deleted.

## September 15 Picture Pilot beta.3 testing update

- Picture Pilot Sorter `0.5.0-beta.3` was published as a GitHub prerelease on
  2026-09-15. It remains **Testing — not final**; wider marketing is still on
  hold until the user downloads this exact build from the live site and completes
  the separate-computer acceptance test.
- GitHub tag: `picture-pilot-sorter-v0.5.0-beta.3-testing`.
- Release asset: `PicturePilotSorter-Windows-0.5.0-beta.3.zip`.
- GitHub download count immediately after publication: **0**.
- ZIP size: **51,301,993 bytes**.
- ZIP SHA-256:
  `D294A9E13E553F8FA3353FBAFF6189EC9A9E3060E418E4EF60BE803F49E92833`.
- Executable SHA-256:
  `811A2C0E489F620C1FD0F78011F7F0FD743293C0BF7A9E76A01B5C108C0EA194`.
- The GitHub release asset row exposed the expected filename, 48.9 MB display
  size, and matching SHA-256 digest. The public Picture Pilot page and homepage
  both showed version `0.5.0-beta.3` with the **Testing — not final** status and
  the exact version-specific download link.
- This beta adds the Scan Report and guarded exact-duplicate reconciliation.
  Only byte-for-byte identical files are consolidated during folder building;
  similar-looking images are never treated as duplicates, and originals remain
  untouched.
