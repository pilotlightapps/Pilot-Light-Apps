# Pilot Light Apps release management

This repository hosts the public website and the downloadable assets for every
Pilot Light Apps product. App development stays in each app's own project; this
repository receives only verified release candidates and finished releases.

## Release layout

- Use one GitHub Release per app version.
- Use app-specific tags so releases remain understandable as the catalog grows.
- Existing Wallpaper Pilot tags `v1.0.0` and `v1.0.1` remain unchanged.
- Future stable tag example: `wallpaper-pilot-v1.1.0`.
- Display / Audio Switcher stable tag: `display-audio-switcher-v1.0.0`.
- Testing tag example: `display-audio-switcher-v0.9.0-testing`.
- Mark testing builds as GitHub prereleases and label them **Testing — not final**
  everywhere on the website.
- Use a version-specific asset URL in `apps.js`; do not use a repository-wide
  `releases/latest/download/...` link on a multi-app website.
- Keep each app's dedicated page URL stable for marketing and analytics. New apps
  receive a compact home-directory card and their own HTML page.

## Required release assets

Each public release should include:

1. The complete runnable EXE, installer, or portable ZIP.
2. A separate SHA-256 text file for the uploaded asset.
3. Release notes with the version, supported platform, installation steps,
   known limitations, signing status, and the same SHA-256 value.

The customer download and the archival release package are different artifacts.
Customer ZIPs must contain only the files required to run or install the app.
Release notes, privacy documents, verification artifacts, source files, manifests,
and internal records stay outside the customer ZIP as separate release assets or
repository records. Before uploading, enumerate the ZIP entries and fail the
release if any unapproved file or folder is present.

Keep asset names stable within an app line. Use a new tag and version-specific
URL when the bytes change so an old checksum never describes a newer file.

## Testing-to-stable process

1. Verify the candidate locally without performing unintended device changes.
2. Publish it as a GitHub prerelease.
3. Add the website card with a prominent testing warning.
4. Download the asset through the public website on a separate Windows computer.
5. Extract or install it exactly as a new user would.
6. Test first launch, required device behavior, tray behavior, public links,
   startup behavior, exit, and any uninstall or cleanup path.
7. Record failures and rebuild under a new testing version when the bytes change.
8. After the separate-computer test passes, publish the stable version and change
   the website status to **Available**.

## Website publishing checklist

- Preserve a known-good H: backup before editing.
- Start from the current GitHub `main` branch.
- Verify there are no unexpected local or remote changes.
- Test the site locally at desktop and mobile widths.
- Check every app card, image, Download button, release-details link, Donate link,
  Contact link, and Privacy link.
- Push one reviewed commit to `main` and wait for GitHub Pages to finish.
- Verify `https://pilotlightapps.com/` rather than assuming a successful push is
  the same as a successful public deployment.
- Synchronize the verified public source back to the private canonical website source.

## Analytics

- Cloudflare Web Analytics measures aggregate website traffic and referrers.
- Because the GitHub Pages records are DNS-only, the Cloudflare beacon must be
  present on every public HTML page unless the site is deliberately proxied later.
- GitHub records a separate download count for each release asset.
- A GitHub download count is not a unique-person or successful-install count.
- Website visitors, Download-button selections, GitHub asset downloads, and
  completed installations must be reported as different measurements.
- Record each app's asset baseline in `ANALYTICS_BASELINE.md` before marketing.
